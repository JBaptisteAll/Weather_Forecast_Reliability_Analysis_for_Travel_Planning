st.markdown("""
Hi, I'm Jean-Baptiste! I'm a passionate learner currently diving deep into 
the world of data analysis and programming. After discovering my love for technology, 
I decided to embark on this journey to master Python, data analysis, and more.

With 20 years of experience in the hospitality and tourism industry, I have developed 
a deep understanding of sector challenges and provide tailored strategic analyses. 
Proficient in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I identify trends, optimize 
decision-making, and enhance business performance.

In my free time, I love exploring nature, especially hiking in the mountains. 🏔️ 
Curious and self-driven, I seek to thrive in a dynamic environment where 
I can continue learning and delivering value.

st.markdown("### Education & Training 🎓")
st.markdown("""
My journey into data began with a strong self-learning approach. 
Driven by curiosity and a passion for analytics, I explored various online 
platforms such as Coursera, where I successfully completed courses from 
Google and Meta, building a solid foundation in data analytics, Python programming, 
and SQL. 📊

To take my expertise to the next level and gain hands-on experience, 
I enrolled in an intensive Data Analytics Bootcamp at [Jedha](https://www.jedha.co/). 
Throughout this program, I worked on real-world datasets, developing skills in 
data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. The bootcamp not only 
refined my technical abilities but also strengthened my problem-solving and 
analytical thinking through practical projects and teamwork.
